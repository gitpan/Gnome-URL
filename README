Gnome/URL version 0.01
======================

This module provides a Perl binding for url handling in
the GNOME (1.x) environment (http://www.gnome.org).  It can handle
various types of URLs including http, https, ftp, file,
info, man, ghelp, and possibly others.

The commands used to view different types of URLs are
determined by the user's gnome configuration (most likely
stored in ~/.gnome/Gnome).

See http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/libgnome/gnome-gnome-url.html
for more information.
